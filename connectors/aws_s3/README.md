# AWS S3 Connector

This project implements a DSX Connector based on the DSX Connector framework.


## Overview


## Development and Debugging
Implement the following in `aws_s3.py`:
- **Startup/Shutdown:** Initialize and clean up resources.

and the following API endpoints as applicable:
- **full_scan:** Request for full repository scan.
- **item_action:** Execute remediation actions on a file.
- **read_file:** Request to retrieve file contents.
- **repo_check:** Request that the connector checks its connectivity to its repository
- **webhook_event:** Process external webhook events.

## Build a Deployment Release

Connectors use Invoke to manage tasks for bundling up files, creating requirements (for pip) and
building a Docker image.  All the steps needed to prepare a new release for deployment.

### Prerequisites
Local running Docker instance: if building a Docker image (a "release")

### Using invoke
```python
pip install invoke
pip install pipreqs # used to generate requirements...
```
Navigate to the root directory (where the tasks.py file resides) and use invoke cli to run tasks
```python
invoke release
```
* Files will be bundled up in the dist folder.
* A requirements.txt file will be generated with all modules needed
* If docker is running locally, a docker image will be built.
* If access to a docker repository is given, the docker image will be pushed to that repository

Other invoke options:
* bump - increments the patch version in version.py (e.g., 1.0.0 to 1.0.1).
* clean - removes the distribution folder (dist/aws-s3-connector-<version>) and its associated zip file if they exist.
* prepare - prepares files for a versioned build.  Copies and moves file into dist/aws-s3-connector-<version>; generates requirements.txt.
* build - (runs bump, clean, prepare) and builds a Docker image tagged as aws-s3-connector:<version> from the prepared dist folder if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
* push - (runs build) tags the Docker image with the repository username (logangilbert/<name>:<version>) and pushes it to Docker Hub.
* release - executes the full release cycle by running the following tasks in order: bump, clean, prepare, build, and push.
